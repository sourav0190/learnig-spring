# 01 - Java Fundamentals

## What concept it covers
This module covers the core building blocks of the Java language.

- **Syntax Basics**: Variable declarations, data types, and fundamental structure.
- **Control Flow**: `if-else` statements, `switch-case`, and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Methods**: Defining and calling functions, parameters, and return types.

## Why it exists
Foundational knowledge is essential before jumping into complex frameworks like Spring. Understanding how Java executes code line-by-line is the first step.

## What I will learn from it
- How to write and run basic Java programs.
- How to control the logic flow of an application.
- How to write reusable code using methods.

## Important Notes
- Focus on `main` method execution.
- Practice with different primitive data types.
