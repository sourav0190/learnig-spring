# 07 - Spring Boot Ecosystem

## What concept it covers
- **Rest API Development**: Controllers, Models, and JSON responses.
- **Spring Security**: Authentication, Authorization, and JWT.
- **JPA & Hibernate**: Database mapping and standard repositories.

## Why it exists
Spring Boot is the industry standard for Java backend development. It simplifies configuration and speeds up development.

## What I will learn from it
- How to build production-ready RESTful APIs.
- How to secure your application.
- How to interact with databases using modern ORM tools.

## Sub-modules:
- `rest-api/`: Focused on building endpoints.
- `jpa-hibernate/`: Focused on data persistence.

> [!NOTE]
> Spring Security projects have been moved to the root `springsecurity/` folder to maintain their original structure.
