# Java Backend Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the Java Backend Learning Repository. This project is structured as a progressive learning journey, moving from basic Java syntax to advanced Spring Boot microservices.

## 🎯 Repository Structure

This repository follows a structured learning flow (episodes):

1.  **[01-java-fundamentals](./01-java-fundamentals/)**: Variables, loops, methods, and syntax.
2.  **[02-oops](./02-oops/)**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.
3.  **[03-collections](./03-collections/)**: Lists, Sets, and Maps.
4.  **[04-exception-handling](./04-exception-handling/)**: Managing errors gracefully.
5.  **[05-jdbc](./05-jdbc/)**: Traditional database connectivity.
6.  **[06-swing](./06-swing/)**: Desktop GUI application development.
7.  **[07-spring-boot](./07-spring-boot/)**: Modern backend development (REST APIs). Note: Spring Security projects are preserved in [springsecurity](./springsecurity/).
8.  **[08-mini-projects](./08-mini-projects/)**: Building real-world applications.
9.  **[09-experimental](./09-experimental/)**: Servlets, Framework internals, and deep dives.

## 🔒 Spring Security
All Spring Security related learning projects are located in the [springsecurity](./springsecurity/) directory to maintain the original structure.

## 🛠 Naming Conventions
- **Folders**: `lowercase-with-hyphen`
- **Packages**: `lowercase`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`

## 🚀 Getting Started
Each major folder contains its own `README.md` with specific installation instructions and learning goals.

**Happy Coding!**
