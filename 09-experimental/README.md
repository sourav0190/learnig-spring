# 09 - Experimental & Deep Dives

## What concept it covers
This folder contains experiments, legacy concepts, and deep dives into the internal working of frameworks.

- **Servlets & JSP**: Understanding how Java Web applications used to be built before Spring Boot.
- **Thymeleaf Demos**: Specific experiments with the Thymeleaf template engine.
- **Spring Internals**: Exploring auto-configuration and dependency injection "under the hood."

## Why it exists
Learning is rarely a straight line. This "sandbox" folder provides a space for exploration that doesn't fit into the main structured roadmap.

## Projects inside:
- `servlet-jsp`: Legacy web concepts.
- `thymeleaf-demos`: Templating experiments.
- `spring-internals`: Understanding Spring's inner magic.
