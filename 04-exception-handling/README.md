# 04 - Exception Handling

## What concept it covers
- **Try-Catch-Finally** blocks.
- **Throw vs Throws**.
- **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**.
- **Custom Exceptions**.

## Why it exists
Robust backend applications must handle errors gracefully without crashing.

## What I will learn from it
- How to identify and fix runtime errors.
- How to design a global error-handling strategy for an API.

## Important Notes
- Never "swallow" exceptions (empty catch blocks).
- Use `finally` for resource cleanup (or try-with-resources).
