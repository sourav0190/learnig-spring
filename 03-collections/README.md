# 03 - Java Collections Framework

## What concept it covers
- **List Interface**: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`.
- **Set Interface**: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`.
- **Map Interface**: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `Hashtable`.
- **Iterators & Comparators**.

## Why it exists
In backend development, you almost always work with groups of objects (lists of users, sets of permissions, etc.).

## What I will learn from it
- Which data structure to choose for specific performance needs.
- How to iterate and manipulate data efficiently.

## Important Notes
- Learn the difference between `Fail-fast` and `Fail-safe` iterators.
- Understand `HashMap` internals (Bucketing, Hashing).
