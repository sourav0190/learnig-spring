# 02 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)

## What concept it covers
The four pillars of OOPS:
- **Classes & Objects**: Blueprints and instances.
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse and hierarchy.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloading and Overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces and Abstract classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding with access modifiers.

## Why it exists
Java is an object-oriented language. Mastering OOPS is critical for building scalable backend systems and understanding Spring's Dependency Injection.

## What I will learn from it
- How to model real-world entities into code.
- How to build flexible and maintainable software architectures.

## Important Notes
- Pay close attention to the `static` keyword and its implications.
- Understand the difference between an `Interface` and an `Abstract Class`.
