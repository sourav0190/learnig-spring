# Spring Security Learning Project

This project contains several sub-modules exploring different aspects of Spring Security:

- `user-registration`: User signup and basic security flow.
- `identity-management`: Advanced authentication and custom user details.
- `multi-role-security`: Role-based access control and in-memory users.
- `security-basic-config`: Minimalistic security setup.

All projects follow a standardized naming convention and directory structure.
